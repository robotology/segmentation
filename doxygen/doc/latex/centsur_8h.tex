\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
An implementation modelling the centre-\/surround response, used for construction of spatial uniqueness maps. 

Based on the difference-\/of-\/\+Gaussians pyramid approach of Itti. A single Gaussian pyramid is created. Neighbouring pyramid entries are subtracted (eg Pyramid level 0 -\/ Pyramid level 1, 1-\/2, 2-\/3 ...etc), and so are 2nd neighbours (eg 1-\/3,2-\/4,3-\/5..etc), to obtain spatial uniqueness at various spatial scales. All resultant subtraction results (the difference of Gaussian maps) are summated to yield the centre-\/surround map output.
